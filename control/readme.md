Jet Control
===========

Control here is used in the colloquial engineering sense to mean "code that involves control theory"

The following groups of files are present

* `jet_vane_mapper*` which computes a set of jet vane angles for a desired wrench

* `quadraframe_model*` which contains functions relating to the physical properties of the quadraframe assembly; see the CAD for visuals

* `jet_vane_model*` which contains functions for computing wrenches generated by individual jet vanes, and information about the jet vane geometry

* `wrench.*` tooling for interacting with wrenches, adding/subtracting them and transforming them between frames

* `*generated_.*` generated code (by [op_graph](https://github.com/jpanikulam/op_graph))


# Work yet to be done

* There are a number hard-coded geometry references that will be inferred from CAD when Jake adds the tooling to do so
